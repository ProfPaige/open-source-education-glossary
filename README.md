## Open Source Education Glossary

I am quite sure that asking me questions in a readme will not work.  :)

This is a readme file.
We want this one readme file on top next to top level repo directories.
It will reference other README.md files in each sub-directory.

We are still waiting for you to target audiences and establish how to support various contributor types.

Likely you will have several such audiences:
- instructors
- students
- faculty

Each of those can contribute different things.....
That will drive your Open Source Education project read me structure.
